# Communication Task
*See [Communication Task Example](notes/Communication%20Task%20Example.md) for an example answer, and discussion around the Communication Task.

*There is official ICE guidance available [here](https://myice.ice.org.uk/getattachment/364ff1ee-d8fc-46d2-864a-7c4f85d8f914/attachment.aspx).

*See the list of topics and response formats [here](notes/Communication%20Task%20Topics%20and%20Response%20Formats.md).

> [!Overview]
> As of 2022, the written exercise conducted at the [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md) was replaced with a "Communication Task". The task aims to validate [6. Interpersonal Skills and Communication](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Professional%20Review%20MOC/6.%20Interpersonal%20Skills%20and%20Communication.md), as well as offer an opportunity for the candidate to demonstrate knowledge and awareness of the wider civil engineering landscape. It is based on the current issues in the industry, and the candidate will be expected to respond as an engaged civil engineer, not a technical expert.

## Format
As per the guidance, *You will be set two questions, each containing a scenario and a format. You will have to choose one question to respond to, and you will have 90 minutes to complete the task. At the CPR and CPRP, the aim is to test your ability to take a piece of information, digest it, organise your thoughts and present them logically and clearly, bearing in mind the audience that you are writing to.*.

Prior to the day of your review, an email with links to join the MS Teams meetings will be provided, for both the review and interview itself, and the communication task which will occur later in the day.

The links should be opened in Incognito/Private Browsing mode, to ensure there are no conflicts if a Microsoft account is already logged in.

Once you have received the email, you will need to: 
	a) Open your browser in Incognito/InPrivate mode. (This is to avoid disruption if you already have a SharePoint account) 
	b) Copy the link and paste it into your browser which will take you to the login page 
	c) Input your email address and the randomly generated password included with the email you have received

## Examples of questions:

> [!NOTE] Example 1
> **Nuclear energy and the balance of risk and reward** 
> With global emissions on a seemingly unstoppable upward trend there are clear concerns that civil engineers are adding to the problem of climate change, but the construction of nuclear facilities could be one of a range of ways to reduce emissions. However, when Greenpeace claims “nuclear power is incredibly expensive, hazardous and slow to build” and with the catastrophic failure at Fukushima in 2011 in recent memory, many feel this is the wrong technology to use, and alternatives must be sought. You have been asked to write a piece by a journalist on this subject for inclusion in an industry supplement.

> [!NOTE] Example 2
> **The need for resilience of infrastructure and how to achieve it.** 
> Covid-19 has shown us that there is a need for resilience to unexpected economic shocks in terms of our infrastructure and its design and maintenance. The time has come for a rethink of what kind of infrastructure is required and how engineers design, build and maintain such infrastructure, as well as what training and development is needed to allow engineers to ensure its fitness for purpose. Write a blog for people with a technical background but without specialist knowledge in civil engineering.

## Instructions
There are a number of important rules to bear in mind when completing the communication task.

In addition to the internet browser/tab being open the only other programs open on your desktop should be the following: 
	o MS Teams – with only the ICE meeting open (if online) o MS Word or a similar program where you are completing your Communication Task – with a blank template to complete your Communication Task 
	o Communication Task instructions (this document) 
	o two sides of A4 material that you have prepared for reference (this is optional). The material can be either printed hardcopy or an MS Word document. Other reference materials and notes are not permitted. 
	▪ If the invigilator notices that you are using unauthorised materials, they will ask you to stop, and a note will be recorded, and your Reviewers informed 
	▪ You are not permitted to talk to anyone during the Communication Task. If you are online, then you should be alone in the room and free of distractions ▪ You must answer only one out of the two questions 
	▪ You will be given a 15-minute warning before the Communication Task is due to finish and then you will be told when you need to stop. You will then be given 15 minutes to upload your response through the portal 
	▪ Leaving your seat should be avoided but if you do need to leave for any reason – toilet breaks, getting a glass of water etc - you must let your invigilator know, by either putting a message in the chat function or raising your hand. You will not be granted extra time 
	▪ If you leave for a significant amount of time or you do not inform the invigilator that you are leaving, this will be considered as breaking the rules and will need to be recorded and your Reviewers informed 
	▪ The Communication Task must be your own work. Where you need to quote exactly from others, be sure to fully reference the source, and where appropriate, enclose the material in quotation marks. A good rule of thumb is that you should treat as quotes any material derived from others except content which could be assumed to be common knowledge, e.g., standard equations in the public domain. The use of re-drawn diagrams/figures is allowed if permission is obtained (where appropriate) and the source is acknowledged
	▪ The use of the internet on your computer or any mobile devices is not permitted during the Communication Task, except to access the Teams meeting, the login email from ICE, and the Communication Task page required to carry out the Communication Task 
	▪ The use of external hard drives and USB memory sticks are not permitted 
	▪ Plagiarism is not acceptable and is taken seriously by ICE. Samples of the Communication Task response will be selected and put through plagiarism detection software, and if this shows significant levels of similarity with any unattributed sources then you will be contacted by the ICE and asked to provide an explanation. Your Reviewers will be provided with a copy of the plagiarism report and your response. Your Reviewers may use this information in the assessment of your Communication Task or other attributes 
	▪ Mobile phones must be turned to silent and put to the side

## Submission
At the end of the allocated time, the invigilator will ask you to stop writing. There will then be a 15 minute window to save and upload your answer document as a PDF file.

## Marking
The Communication Task forms part of the assessment of the Interpersonal Skills and Communication attribute, your written response will be assessed against the following three criteria:

	▪ Knowledge and relevance 
	▪ Use of English (grammar and syntax) 
	▪ Clarity and presentation 

Please remember that at IEng-level your Reviewers are looking for evidence that you can report factual information clearly, while at CEng-level they will be looking for you to organise your thoughts and deliver them in writing in a clear and logical fashion, bearing in mind the needs of the audience you are writing for.
