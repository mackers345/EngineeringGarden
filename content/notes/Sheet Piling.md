# Sheet Piling
Sheet Piling is the process of driving large sheets of metal into the ground in order to provide ground support. This is a commonly prescribed area of [Temporary Works](notes/Temporary%20Works%20MOC.md). 

## Definitions
[Pre-Augering](notes/Pre-Augering.md) - the process of reducing the density of the ground by essentially pre-drilling the area of sheet pile installation with an auger attached. The auger spins clockwise through the initial augering process, then counter-clockwise when being removed. This ensures the soils stays in place, however it breaks through the dense soils and makes the installation of sheet piles easier.
