# 2022 Presidential Address Notes

[Keith Howells](notes/Keith%20Howells.md) takes over from [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md), as ICE President for 2022.

ðŸ•™ See last year's notes: [2021 ICE Presidential Address Notes](notes/2021%20ICE%20Presidential%20Address%20Notes.md)

## Starts with [[Ed McCann]], reviewing the past year
*What have we done to address carbon this year?*

- Working to revise PAS 2080 and produce guidance documentation.
- Carbon Champions Programme
- Established UK low carbon concrete board, sets out the way to de-carbonising concrete.
- Produced content around carbon literacy, uploaded to the ICE literary hub.

Personally, [Ed McCann](People/Ed%20McCann.md) has been addressing and defining productivity within civil engineering, producing the State of the Nation report which sets out focus areas. Highlighted the Productivity Community Advisory Board, pushing forward in productivity. Started the journey which he hopes will be continued by [Keith Howells](notes/Keith%20Howells.md).

Introduced a new qualification for infrastructure workers. Embraces new skills, people and backgrounds to join.

### Introduces Keith Howells

Highlights the [2020 5-year plan produced by the ICE](attachments/state-of-the-nation-2020-infrastructure-and-the-net-zero-target.pdf).

Reiterated the ICE core purpose:

> "To improve lives by ensuring the world has the engineering capacity and infrastructure systems it needs to allow our planet and those who live on it to thrive."

Keith readdresses the core purpose, hoping to give a view of how the ICE is going to target this focusing on the [UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals](notes/UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md). 

Sets out the ICE Plan for 2023-2027:

#### The ICE Plan for 2023-2027

> 1) To raise engineering standards: specifically, by conferring professional qualifications on our members
> 	a) Assuring the public that the ICE takes public safety seriously. Refers to the [ICE Royal Charter](notes/ICE%20Royal%20Charter.md): *"Many important works which contribute to the well-being of society are dependent on civil engineers, and call for a high degree of professional knowledge and judgement; there should be a ready means of ascertaining persons who by proper training and experience are qualified to carry out such works."*
> 	b) Calls for continuing professional development improvement, highlighted in the ["In plain sight: assuring the whole-lift safety of infrastructure" ICE publication](attachments/in-plain-sight.pdf).
> 	c) Reiterates CPD guidance and topic on the [ICE website](https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-learning/).
> 2) To put the decarbonisation of our industry at the heart of our agenda
> 3) To transform the productivity of our industry through modern methods of procurement and construction, including the widespread use of data and digital technology
> 4) To work with others to build resilience and mitigate the effects of climate change on our infrastructure
> 	a) Look to nature based solutions where available
> 5) To transform the availability of water, sanitation and affordable clean energy, particularly in the global south
> 	a) Calls to alleviate hardship in lesser-developed areas in regards to the availability of clean drinking water. Highlights climate change responsible for changing rainfall patterns, making farming unpredictable as well as changing the composition of farmland. The effect on wildlife and the combustibility of plants and crops is also highlighted.
> 	b) Highlights the [flash-flooding in Pakistan](https://www.unicef.org/emergencies/devastating-floods-pakistan-2022) as another example of climate change.
> 6) To develop a technology-focused mobility and transportation programme, to facilitate a reduction in the carbon intensity of transport
> 7) To work with others to enhance the knowledge, insight and ethical understanding of engineers
> 	a) Calls upon engineers to increase their knowledge and awareness of issues in the world in regards to safety. This can lead to practical solutions which can target the [SDGs](notes/UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md). 
> 	

The problems arising from climate change will be addressed by small, incremental changes over time.

> "We need to become outcome, not output focused; delivering our projects in a way that are generally sustainable, so that we create a viable future for generations to come."

Output = road or bridge
Outcome = connecting communities, increasing industry and transit, improving family links

#### What does this look like in the real world?
Plays a video showing good awareness and use to target the [UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals](notes/UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md). 

In Scotland, a monitoring and canal technology allows the development of 3000 new homes, which would lead to more people in the area within the city, leading into health benefits and wider benefits arising from sustainable development. Gives access to affordable housing.

In India, an ancient drainage system was insufficient to drain the climate related flooding. A machine was lowered into the sewers to remove the silting and address damage. A low-friction lining was placed into the sewer to allow the material to drain much quicker. Leads to less illness and money on healthcare due to no waterlogged streets.

In Peru, the El Nino flooding affected 1 million people. The UK "Reconstruction with Changes" is constructing 15 hospitals, 74 schools and flood management infrastructure in a 1.7 billion pound regeneration project. Monitoring is installed to alert for flash-flood risks, and earthquake and flooding resistant schools and hospitals have been installed. Landscaping and trees have been installed to capture carbon, reduce emissions and increase sustainability.

### What is the ICE currently doing to address these goals?

 - Decarbonisation - collaborated with the BSI to update PAS 2080, the standard for managing carbon in the delivery of infrastructure projects. Worked with the Low Carbon Concrete Group, to produce a route-map of better methods to reduce carbon in concrete.
 - Productivity - [State of the Nation report](attachments/state_of_the_nation_working_paper_final-1.pdf). Enabling Better Infrastructure Programme is a vital resource for decision makers. Next UN review of the SDGs is going to focus on Infrastructure - the ICE will be giving feedback and updates.
 - The ICE acknowledges they cannot do everything, so collaboration has been promoted: for example, with the [International Coalition for Sustainable Infrastructure](https://www.resilienceshift.org/international-coalition-for-sustainable-infrastructure/).
