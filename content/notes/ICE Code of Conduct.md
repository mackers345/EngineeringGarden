# ICE Code of Conduct

> The ICE Code of Conduct can be summarised by one phrase: *do the right thing*. The code of conduct sets out a set of duties which should be followed by ICE members in order to behave ethically and in standing with the ICE. 
> *"Members of the ICE should always be aware of their overriding responsibility to the public good"*.
