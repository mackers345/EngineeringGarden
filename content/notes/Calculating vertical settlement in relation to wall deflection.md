# Calculating vertical settlement in relation to wall deflection

When using a [sheet pile](notes/Sheet%20Piling.md) or other type of [Retaining Wall](notes/Retaining%20Wall.md), the deflection of that wall can influence the ground around it in regards to vertical settlement. 

CIRIA C760, Section 6.2.2 gives guidance on embedded retaining walls and the influence of the wall deflection on adjacent settlement. The diagram gives a general view on the effect of deflection on settlement - note however that this related to top propped walls and the deflection is different.

To complete this, you can complete a deflection check using [Wallap](notes/Wallap.md) or hand-calculations to assess the maximum deflection, as well as the point at which the deflection stops. 

D = depth to maximum deflection (m)
H = midpoint of embedded wall (m)
d = depth to zero wall deflection (m)
Î´ = maximum deflection (m)

Following this, you can use the relationships given in the figure above, or the Excel spreadsheet [here]() to assess the wall deflection.
