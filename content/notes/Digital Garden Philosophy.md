# Digital Garden Philosophy

## Lego and bottlecaps
When I was younger, I absolutely loved collecting things. I remember as a young lad I had a bag full of bottlecaps under the sink. I went to Turkey and started collecting little metal cars, organising them and sorting them into collections.

There was nothing that brought me more joy as a 10 year old than collecting every individual character in Lego Star Wars and see the little grid of characters slowly fill up.

*Lego Star Wars character grid - gotta collect them all!*

I think this mentality followed me through university and into work; I started collecting fragments of information and building them into an easily sort-able, searchable system which can become greater than the sum of its parts. I make individual standard solutions for design problems and stitch them together piecemeal to solve problems. I record notes of workshops and courses, picking out the most important parts and summarising them in my own words.

I believe this is why I have such an affinity with a notes-taking application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian allows you to create as many individual notes as you want and link them together; similar to synapses in the brain. I can span any topic and find links between them; whether that be an interesting point in a film which links to a book I read a few years ago, or a method of analysing a concrete slab, the principles of which link to an element of geotechnical design. Also, my regular memory truly is awful, so being able to offload information frees up my mental clarity.

## The architect, the gardener and the librarian
This matches my way of thinking as a "gardener". There are three types of note-taker as per this [article from Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app#:~:text=Notion.,track%20your%20tasks%2C%20and%20more.).

> -   **The architect.** They enjoy planning, designing processes and frameworks, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily structure their ideas.
> -   **The gardener.** They enjoy exploring, connecting various thoughts together, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily grow their ideas.
> -   **The librarian.** They enjoy collecting, building a catalogue of resources, and need a note-taking tool that allows them to easily retrieve their ideas.

After a few years of building a system for myself in the [Civil Engineering](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md) field while gaining experience as a Highways Engineer and starting a design placement, I was able to sign off my [ICE Training Agreement](notes/ICE%20Training%20Agreement.md) and start preparing for my [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md). My Obsidian system grew and grew as I collated my experience and knowledge into one [Professional Report](notes/Professional%20Report.md). At this time, I found a way to publish and share these notes. 

After all, the best way to learn and remember is to teach others.

## The civil engineering garden
The [Civil Engineering Garden](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC.md) is the output of this process; a simple to read and understand distillation of my knowledge in civil engineering and other [areas](notes/Areas%20MOC.md). It will be constantly changing, evolving and updating as my own knowledge increases. In places it will be freeform, messy and unfinished; however this is meant to be my own way of remembering things. Notes are never truly finished, never capture everything to know on a topic. They evolve and grow...

...a little bit like a garden.

If you are reading this, then you are along for the ride as well.

Happy reading, and I really encourage you to start building a system like this yourself! It genuinely changed my life.

If you want a simple run through of the second brain system and a blueprint of how to create something for yourself, then I recommend the book [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
