*The following information is a summary of the [government guidance](https://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/index.htm) on the CDM regulations.*

# Commercial client
> A commercial client has construction carried out as part of their business. This can be an individual, partnership or company.

The distinction between a [commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) and a [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md) is that the following duties apply **in full** to a commercial client, whereas some duties may be passed down the chain in a domestic case.

Commercial clients are critical in managing [health and safety](notes/Health%20and%20Safety.md) on site, including the management of health and safety risks.

> Whatever the project size, the commercial client has contractual control, appoints designers and contractors, and determines the money, time and other resources for the project.

For all projects, commercial clients must:

-   make suitable arrangements for managing their project, enabling those carrying it out to manage health and safety risks in a proportionate way. These arrangements  include:
    -   appointing the [contractor](notes/Contractor.md) and [designer](notes/Designer.md) to the project (including the [Principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md) and [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md) on projects involving more than one contractor) while making sure they have the skills, knowledge, experience and organisational capability
    -   allowing sufficient time and resources for each stage of the project
    -   making sure that any [principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md) and [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md) appointed carry out their duties in managing the project
    -   making sure suitable welfare facilities are provided for the duration of the construction work
-   maintain and review the management arrangements for the duration of the project
-   provide [Pre-construction information](notes/Pre-construction%20information.md) to every designer and contractor either bidding for the work or already appointed to the project
-   ensure that the principal contractor or contractor (for single contractor projects) prepares a construction phase plan before that phase begins
-   ensure that the principal designer prepares a **[Health and Safety File](notes/Health%20and%20Safety%20File.md)** for the project and that it is revised as necessary and made available to anyone who needs it for subsequent work at the site - this is the main part of the handover for future works.

For notifiable projects (where planned construction work will last longer than 30 working days and involves more than 20 workers at any one time; or where the work exceeds 500 individual worker days), commercial clients must:

-   [notify HSE in writing with details of the project](https://www.hse.gov.uk/forms/notification/f10.htm)
-   ensure a copy of the notification is displayed in the construction site office
