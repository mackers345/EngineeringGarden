# Domestic client
> The domestic client is different to the [Commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) in that the client is not part of any business, and is not taking on the construction work as part of their business.

Usually, the following duties pass to these following parties:

-   theÂ [contractor](notes/Contractor.md), if it is a single contractor project, who must take on the legal duties of the client in addition to their own as contractor. In practice, this should involve little more than what they normally do in managing health and safety risks
-   the [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md), for projects with more than one contractor, who must take on the legal duties of the client in addition to their own as principal contractor. If the domestic client has not appointed a principal contractor, the client duties must be carried out by the contractor in control of the construction work

If an architectural firm or individual is involved in the project, and is running the project on behalf of the [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md), then they may take on the client's CDM duties instead of the client.

Any designer in charge of coordinating and managing a project is assumed to be the [principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md). However, if they do not have a written agreement with the domestic client to confirm they are taking on the client duties, those duties automatically pass to the principal contractor.
