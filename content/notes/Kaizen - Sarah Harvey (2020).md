# Mental Model
---
MM:: Kaizen is an approach to life revolving around continuous improvement, themes similar to those presented in [Atomic Habits - James Clear (2018)](notes/Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear%20(2018).md) or Make Time; namely, ways to slowly steer your life to your desired destination through a series of small, incremental improvements. "Kaizen" translates to "change for the better", and through this book Harvey suggests a number of "First Kaizen Steps" to start you on your journey to betterment, underpinned by a number of core principles.

> After living in Japan for six months, I became fascinated by how small details and incremental change were given more emphasis in Japanese daily life.

### before starting
Harvey breaks down some key areas of life and suggests small, frictionless ways in which they can be improved through a Kaizen approach. The key underpinning of this is something considered in [Atomic Habits - James Clear (2018)](notes/Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear%20(2018).md); make every action as simple and as pain-free as possible.

#### take an inventory
Before thinking about how you can change your life, you need to know your starting point. Harvey recommends completing a brain dump, or a full and honest analysis of your current life and affairs. For example:
 - What is your relationship with your body? How is your mental health?
 - Are you happy in your job?
 - How are your finances? Are you already investing or are you a serial spender?
 - How do you feel about your immediate environment?
This questions can be applied along with other questions around relationships and your desire for new challenges. I believe that this should not be a one-time activity, but rather a continuous assessment and reflection about your current state and desires.

> Rather than only listing things you are currently unhappy about, try to include some new and exciting possibilities as well.

### change for the better
The remainder of the book following this initial setup process is a deep dive into the cornerstones of life; examine your state and apply small steps to seamlessly guide your life towards a better place. The following are some standout "Kaizen Steps" from each of these areas. Note that some of these are short-term and long-term goals.

#### Health
Health and diet are a real focus for me at the moment, with a strong approach to be more disciplined in controlling and monitoring my health and diet.
 - *Find an unusual way to exercise* - Despite the general male pressure to be a certain type of 'fit', I can never find motivation to go exclusively to the gym. This helped me realise that my favoured routine of american football and soccer is good enough. This also applies to another approach - *Remember that walking, shopping and dancing all count!* **Kaizen Step** - research a class and plan your outfit to wear for it.

#### Diet
 - *Link your water consumption to another moment in your day* - I now drink a pint of water while waiting for the kettle to boil for my morning coffee.
 - *Use fruit to sweeten items instead of raw sugar* - using a bit of nice raspberry jam makes me feel a little bit better about getting my morning sweet hit.
 - *Measure your food* - I was always a "grab a handful of pasta" kind-of-person but now, keeping the kitchen scales by the hob makes me slightly more inclined to actually measure them out.

#### Sleep
Similarly above, being more mindful and disciplined with my sleep and wake times is slowly having a positive effect on my life.
 - *Declutter your room* - it is so easy to keep yesterday's clothes on the floor but putting them away and getting tomorrow's clothes out, nice and steamed makes me a lot more settled in the evening.
 - *Surround yourself with nice smells* - reed diffusers have become a bit of an obsession recently.

#### Work
 - *Invest in some plants* - I am the only one in my design office that have any plants around my desk - they make a difference!
 - *Do a little bit every day* - while trying to develop a writing habit, I am aiming to wake up a little earlier each day to complete a small amount of writing. I hope to improve my typing speed and be a little less precious about the output!

#### Money
 - *Leave the item for 24 hours* - this is a sentiment I have heard across a number of similar books but by adding an item to your basket and returning the next day, you are much less likely to require it.
 - *Change the environments that make you want to spend* - adding Amazon to a blocked-list for example stops mindless scrolling, and finding a version of Instagram that hides ads also helps.

#### Home
I am already a keen home-minimalist, and one of my favourite activities at home is to tidy and clean. I find it therapeutic and satisfying to organise my most inhabited spaces. Harvey makes a case for opting to keep and repair older items, trying to cut down on today's rampant consumerism.
 - *Mend holes, broken zips and rips*, *Recycle, recycle, recycle* and *Sell, sell, sell!* all adhere to this.

#### Relationships
In today's world, I find it harder and harder to find things in common with people, and trying to build rapport is a challenge for a relative introvert like myself. Reading this reminded me however that quality over quantity should always be strived for.
 - *Let your loved ones know how important they are to you* - I have made a much more concerted effort to show appreciation and gratitude to those that mean a lot to me. It makes me feel better when I hear the same, so why should I reserve affection to my partner and friends?
 - *Celebrate your independence* - something which has held be back from making deeper connections has been a reservation to display my interests and likes. In most cases, I just like hearing from people that are passionate about something, so I should be less afraid to be open and honest! This may help me *find my tribe*, as Harvey also writes about.

### fail upwards
Incorporating Kaizen steps into your daily life is not a straight-forward task, however it is this continuous improvement that means that if you do stumble, you are most likely ahead of where you started. Seek support from others, build accountability for yourself, and foster a link to your community to help you along this path.

### who would I recommend this book to?
Anyone who is looking for a quick-start guide to improvement, or someone who is looking for new ideas to start.

### if you liked this...
I would recommend the obvious comparison of [Atomic Habits - James Clear (2018)](notes/Atomic%20Habits%20-%20James%20Clear%20(2018).md), for a deeper dive into how to proactively build these habits into your daily routine, and [Wabi Sabi - Beth Kempton (2018)](notes/Wabi%20Sabi%20-%20Beth%20Kempton%20(2018).md) for a further celebration of Japanese culture.
