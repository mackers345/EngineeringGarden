# Contractor
> A contractor is anyone manages construction work, or who directly employs or engages construction workers. 

Contractors can include [subcontractors](notes/Sub-Contractor.md), any individual self-employed worker or business that carries out and manages construction work. As with the [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md), they must have sufficient skills, knowledge, experience and organisational capability to carry out the work they have been requested to carry out. 

Contrary to [designer](notes/Designer.md)s, there is less opportunity to remove and eliminate risks and hazards, therefore the management of [Health and Safety](notes/Health%20and%20Safety.md) is more related to avoiding harm in the construction phase.

When working as the only contractor for a [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md), they must adopt the [client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) duties as well as their own as contractor. If there are multiple contractors, the principal contractor may take on the client responsibilities and act as the client to the multiple contractors.

Contractors on **all projects** must:

-   make sure the [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md) or [commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) is aware of the client duties under CDM 2015 before any work starts
-   plan, manage and monitor all work carried out by themselves and their workers, taking into account the risks to anyone who might be affected by it (including members of the public) and the measures needed to protect them
-   check that all workers they employ or appoint have the skills, knowledge, training and experience to carry out the work, or are in the process of obtaining them
-   make sure that all workers under their control have a suitable, site-specific induction, unless this has already been provided by the [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md).
-   provide appropriate  supervision, information and instructions to workers under their control
-   ensure they do not start work on site unless reasonable steps have been taken to prevent unauthorised access
-   ensure suitable welfare facilities are provided from the start for workers under their control, and maintain them throughout the work

In addition to the above responsibilities, contractors working on **projects involving more than one contractor** must:

-   coordinate their work with the work of others in the project team
-   comply with directions given by the [principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md) or principal contractor
-   comply with parts of the [construction phase plan (PDF)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis80.pdf) relevant to their work

Where a contractor is **the only contractor working on a project**, they must ensure a [construction phase plan (PDF)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis80.pdf) is drawn up before setting up the site.
