# Compensation Event (CE)
A compensation event is a reassessment of cost or the allocated time to complete a task due to events outside the control of the Subcontractor. An example of this may be access to a work location not being available due to the overrunning of a previous activity which eats into the Subcontractors programme of work. These events should be resolved as close to the work activity as possible, not at the end of the project.
