# UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals

> [!NOTE] The UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
> In September 2015, all of the [UN member states](notes/UN%20member%20states.md) convened and developed 17 development goals to be targeted through to 2030. Each of these goals had a successful outcome defined, and a number of measurable targets to aim for. See [The History of the UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals](notes/The%20History%20of%20the%20UNESCO%20Sustainable%20Development%20Goals.md).

> [!NOTE] Progress
> You can see the [Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022 Notes](notes/Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202022%20Notes.md) for progress against each of the below goals, or my notes [here](notes/Sustainable%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202022%20Notes.md). An example of a civil engineering contractors approach to reaching this goal can be found [here](notes/Galliford%20Try%20Net%20Zero%202030.md).

## The SDGs in Civil Engineering
### The [Institution of Civil Engineers](notes/Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers.md) Involvement
The ICE have set out a [Sustainability Route Map](https://myice.ice.org.uk/knowledge-and-resources/sustainability-route-map) which sets out their approach to contributing to the sustainability goals laid out by UNESCO, including the embedding of the goals in the [Professional Review](notes/Professional%20Review%20MOC.md).
