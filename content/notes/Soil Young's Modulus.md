# Soil Young's Modulus

> Soil Young's modulus (E), commonly reffred to as soil elastic modulus, is an elastic soil parameter and a measure of soil stiffness. It is defined as the ratio of the stress along an axis over the strain along that axis in the range of elastic soil behaviour. The elastic modulus is often used for estimation of soil settement and elastic deformation analysis.

The below values are useful for reference in using computer programmes or conducting hand calculations. [Wallap](notes/Wallap.md) requires the input of these values for analysis.
