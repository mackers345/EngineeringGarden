# W Clauses

Either a W1 or W2 method of [[Dispute Resolution]] can be opted for within an [[NEC3]] [[contract]].

According to [NEC Contract Website](https://www.neccontract.com/news/how-adjudication-by-consent-under-w1-aligns-with-statutory-adjudication#:~:text=Key%20points,of%20powers%20is%20non%2Dexhaustive.) :

-   Option W1 provides for consensual adjudication on NEC projects while option W2 is for mandatory adjudication on projects subject to the UK Construction Act.
-   A recent case confirmed the adjudicatorâ€™s powers are the same in options W1 and W2, and the list of powers is non-exhaustive.
