# Pre-Augering
The process of reducing the density of the ground by essentially pre-drilling the area of sheet pile installation with an auger attached. The auger spins clockwise through the initial augering process, then counter-clockwise when being removed. This ensures the soils stays in place, however it breaks through the dense soils and makes the installation of sheet piles easier.
