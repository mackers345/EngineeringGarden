# Journalist Piece
I believe a journalist piece should be informative but almost from the perspective of someone going in without knowing something. Give some background to the topic, what you are looking to investigate, and follow it up with research. Be like, "I was looking to expand my knowledge and find out more about this topic". 

In this context, if it is for an engineering magazine, you should assume the audience has a general background knowledge about construction, but you are looking to enhance their knowledge further. Set out a summary at the start.

Starting with a summary statement in bold, setting up the article to come is useful.
