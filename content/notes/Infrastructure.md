# Infrastructure

> [!NOTE] Definition
> [Defined as](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/infrastructure) "the basic systems and services, such as transport and power supplies, that a country or organisation uses in order to work effectively.


### Useful Resources
#### Water + Sanitation
Water and sanitation is a key part of civil engineering; areas in which engineering can influence water and santitation is within:
 - Wastewater/sewerage catchments - in developing countries, ensuring wastewater is captured helps prevent the spread of disease and provide heath, privacy and safety. 
 - Wastewater treatment - a process used to remove contaminants from wastewater and convert it into an effluent that can be returned to the water cycle.
 - Clean water distribution infrastructure - an interconnected collection of sources, pipes and hydraulic control elements. 
 - Clean water treatment - involves the removal of contaminants or inactivation of harmful microbes.

#### Energy Supply
There are a number of factors affecting energy supply.
1) Physical factors - fossil fuels were formed hundreds of years ago, and the geology required to house them can be unpredictable. There isn't an unlimited supply of these mateirals.
2) Cost of exploitation and production - there are a number of costs not initially visible in regards to energy supply, such as wages of the miners. Some resources are too expensive to relinquish from the ground, for example the UK has goal reserves that it is not feasible to mine. 
3) Technology - solar panels, wind turbines and gas extraction are new technologies that can be brought in.
4) Political factors - war can destroy energy resources, corruption and lack of funding can all contribute.

#### Infrastructure Resilience
Infrastructure resilience can be [defined as](https://www.gov.uk/research-for-development-outputs/introducing-infrastructure-resilience) "the robustness of a structure to withstand hazards". This can be influenced through the adherence to appropriate engineering standards, with increased safety factors and appropriate detail. 
It is important to consider that appropriate codes and guidance may not reflect the upcoming climatic uncertainties. The challenge, referred to as the 'Trilemma' by the ICE for adoption and sustainability in regards to energy supply is:
1) Decarbonisation - carbon and other GHG emissions from energy supply and use must be reduced in order to reduce climate change impacts. 
2) Security of supply - an adequate security of energy supply must be maintained, including resilience to both short-term and long-term challenges.
3) Cost - the cost of energy must be affordable for consumers.

Civil engineers can contribute to the Trilemma in the following ways:
 - Constructing new energy infrastructure, including low carbon electricity generation and electricity transmission
 - Integrating energy efficiency measures into all aspects of the built environment
 - Innovating to deliver cost reductions in delivering decarbonised energy and increasing resilience
 - Controlling and limiting all potential impacts of energy infrastructure on the environment (climate change, but also air, water and land)
 - Using low carbon materials and methods for construction
 - Providing the knowledge, skills and people to make low carbon energy a reality
 - Advising on policy frameworks required for investor confidence and promote a stable, long-term vision for supply while retaining flexibility and market signals in delivery.

#### Transport Connectivity
Transport connectivity can relate to the ease at which individuals and vehicles can access different parts of the country. This is important to ensure people have the capacity to trade, travel and do business, regardless of their location in the country. Generally, the UK is a good place to live in regards to travel connectivity. 

The ICE conducted a survey in which the public were asked which travel improvements they would like to see. The top answers were:

1) Cheaper cost of travel
2) Faster journey time
3) More direct journeys

It is important to ensure any investment can affect and not marginalise certain groups of people. For example, Glasgow has received a high amount of infrastructure investment in it's public transport systems. While cars have been prioritised with new roads, the level of bus transport has dropped and had less investment, meaning those that do not live close to a train station or own a car are a bit left behind.
