# Briefing Note


> [!NOTE] Briefing Note
> *A briefing paper, or briefing note, is a document that is used to **inform decision makers** (a board, a politician, etc.) on current issues.  It is a clear and concise document that summarizes an issue and **identifies key pieces of information** like a situation that needs to be addressed and the **financial implications**.  Briefing papers can also **offer recommendations** on how to address the issues.*
> 
> A briefing note, similar to a [Summary Note](notes/Summary%20Note.md) is intended to provide a summary of a topic to a third-party without resorting to technical language. The language should be more formal and concise than that in the [Summary Note](notes/Summary%20Note.md). The output of the note, contrary to the other responses, is to provide some options and a recommended course of action to someone that can affect it.

### Format
The suggested format of the briefing note, as per the ICE session, is recommended as:

1) Introduction / executive summary → Purpose of the note, highlighting the key points
2) Background and discussion → Summarise the context, give various perspectives
3) Conclusions → Present the choices and recommend a course of action, offer solutions

Some discussion points again from the session, led to these questions being asked:

The [Rasmussen](https://rasmussen.libanswers.com/faq/313397) guide recommends the following format:
-   **Name:** Identify the audience for the briefing paper
-   **Date of preparation**
-   **Contact for the briefing note**: Include your contact information including phone and email
-   **Subject/issue:**  A concise statement of the subject or issue and identifies why the briefing note is important
-   **Background:** Give information on past events or issues to provide context.  How did we get here?  What previous actions were taken?  
-   **Current status:**  Explain the current situation, who is involved, what decisions are being made, etc.
-   **Key information:**  Summarize important facts, considerations, and developments in an unbiased manner.  You want to include all of the important information needed for a decision maker to make a decision about the issue.  Provide evidence and double-check your facts. *Consider adding these in as graphics or flowcharts if this makes things clearer and more accessible for the reader*.
-   **Options/recommendations:**  Share the pros and cons of the options and provide any clear, direct, and evidence-based recommendations.
-   **Conclusion:**  Summarize the key information shared in the briefing document
