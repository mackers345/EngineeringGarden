# Scopes of Carbon-Dioxide Emissions

*Taken from Plana.Earth guide [here](https://plana.earth/academy/what-are-scope-1-2-3-emissions).

Carbon emissions are responsible for 81% of all overall greenhouse gas emissions, and companies including construction are largely responsible for this.

Carbon emissions can be categories by 3 scopes; scope 1, 2 and 3.

## Scope 1 - Direct
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from company-owned and controlled resources; that is, those emitted as a result of direct activities originating from the company itself. This is split into four categories:

1) **Stationary combustion:** the emissions resulting from fueling or heating company buildings.
2) **Mobile combustion:** the emissions resulting from all vehicles owned or controlled by a firm. This is why [Galliford Try](notes/Galliford%20Try%20Net%20Zero%202030.md) are making such a big effort to switch all company vehicles to electric cars and plant.
3) **Fugitive emissions:** leaks from air conditioning units or refrigeration.
4) **Process emissions:** the production of CO2 from cement manufacturing, or industrial processes in which the company is in control.

## Scope 2 - Indirect
Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions originating from the generation of purchased energy. This is the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat and cooling.

## Scope 3 - Indirect - not owned
Scope 3 are indirect emissions originating from not-owned assets. This can be split into many different categories, and makes up the bulk of the emissions. The categories can include:

1) Upstream activities - can include commuting and travel
2) Waste generation
3) Purchased goods - all emissions from cradle to grave from production of goods and services
4) Transportation and distribution
5) Fuel and energy-related activities
6) Capital goods
7) Downstream activities
8) Investments
9) Franchises
10) Leased assets
11) Use of sold products
