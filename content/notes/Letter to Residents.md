# Letter to Residents


> [!NOTE] Letter to residents
> A letter to residents should be to provide information to a set group of people, with perhaps a greater focus on actionable steps they can take.

Writing a letter to local residents needs to follow the proper format of a letter, that is:

1) Your address and information in the top right
2) Their address and information below this to the left
3) Introductory line (e.g Dear Sir/Madam)
4) Closing line (Yours Sincerely for known name, Yours Faithfully if not)

An example of this formatting can be found [here](https://www.ukpostbox.com/blog/how-to-format-formal-letter).

It is important to remember the audience and avoid colloquial or technical terms. Think about what information they need to understand from the letter, and how you can put this across.

The guidance from the ICE communication task sessions was:


> [!NOTE] ICE Guidance
> •Think about the purpose / objective of the letter, and keep it focused.
> •Consider your audience and tailor the content of the report to suit – i.e. technical / non-technical colleagues (CEng Att. 8)
> •Give the letter a clear structure
> •Consider the tone of the letter, maintain professional language, and avoid colloquial terms.
> •Think about diversity and inclusion
