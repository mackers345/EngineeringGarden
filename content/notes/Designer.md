# Designer
> A designer is an organisation or individual whose work involves preparing or modifying designs, drawings, specifications, bills of quantity or design calculations.

Designers can make up a whole host of different job roles, including architects, consulting engineers, quantity surveyors and interior designers. They do not necessarily have to be a different entity to a [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md); some organisations can have both designers and contractors in the makeup of their business.

It is common engineering knowledge, following the [ERICPD](notes/ERICPD.md) model that the best time to mitigate and avoid [Health and Safety](notes/Health%20and%20Safety.md) incidents is early on in the design process. By thinking about the [Project life-cycle](notes/Project%20life-cycle.md), designers have an opportunity to impact everyone that interacts, uses, maintains, refurbishes and eventually demolishes the work.

As a designer, there is no difference in working with a [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md) and a [commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md).

Designers must:

-   make sure the client is aware of the client duties under CDM 2015 before starting any design work
-   when preparing or modifying designs:
    -   take account of any pre-construction information provided by the client (and principal designer, if one is involved)
    -   eliminate foreseeable health and safety risks to anyone affected by the project (if possible)
    -   take steps to reduce or control any risks that cannot be eliminated
-   provide design information to:
    -   the [principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md) (if involved), for inclusion in the pre-construction information and the health and safety file
    -   the client and principal contractor (or the [contractor](notes/Contractor.md) for single contractor projects) to help them comply with their duties, such as ensuring a [construction phase plan (PDF)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis80.pdf) is prepared
-   communicate, cooperate and coordinate with:
    -   any other designers (including the principal designer) so that all designs are compatible and ensure health and safety, both during the project and beyond
    -   all contractors (including the principal contractor), to take account of their knowledge and experience of building designs
