# 2021 ICE Presidential Address Notes

[ICE Presidential Address 2021, online](https://www.ice.org.uk/eventarchive/ice-presidential-address-2021)

**Current President: Ed McCann**

Rachel Skinner passes over the baton to Ed McCann.

An abridged transcript of Rachel Skinner's "Shaping zero: towards net-zero carbon for infrastructure" can be found below. Rachel does not regret her theme - it appears that each President has their own theme to target throughout their tenure. They engage with others in the industry and aim to push this forward.

Rachel discusses her change in approach as the year progressed, from attacking the decarbonisation, looking more long term, to appreciating that the defensive approach and dealing with the current effects and dealing with them is just as important. Understanding, packaging and distributing the issue in a comprehensible way is very important.

The next step is taking this understanding and appreciation, and moving to "how" do we deal with this. We will be judged on our approach and action in dealing with the climate crisis.

Passes over to Ed to explain his theme and approach.

Climate change is the key challenge we face in the 21st century.

3 steps:

1) Understand and accept role
2) Stop emitting carbon, reduce emissions
3) Adapt by focusing on improvement

> Aristotle - 'the unexamined life is not worth living'.

Insert background to Ed.

"importance of critical thinking of deep understanding when trying to identify and solve problems"

"importance of understanding impact on people who have to live with your solutions"

"if you dont understand the construction process, you cannot design"

speaks about endemic over-specification and the effect of this on carbon emissions

speaks about the lack of techniques and technology being used to collect data, plan and operate effectively. He led research into costs of error in construction. Between 10-25% construction costs down to error.

**How to thrive in the 21st century - video**

We need to change

- our personal motivations
- climate change
- stigma towards ai

what are we going to do?

how are we going to do it?

effectiveness - do the correct thing, good solution

efficiency -  do that without unneccesary waste or harm

**Productivity is the key driver for tackling issues. Productivity is a combination of effectiveness and efficiency.**

Main causes of failure (using soup example):

- overordering
- using the wrong tools
- waste

Recent studies show wasteful behaviours, time, energy, information, data.

Encourages individuals to assess their own effectiveness and efficiency.

Diversity - bring in all human capability and ideas into targeting problems. Data scientists, community engagement specialists, widen the horizons to start effective collaboration to target productivity. Between countries, disciplines, companies etc.

Hard to bring these in:
- unstable supply chain, moving goalposts
- new technologies are not commercially accepted to bring in.

Many companies short term benefit from over designing or issues where the climate is affected.
