# Temporary Works MOC
> "Temporary works can be described as providing an "engineered solution" that is used to support or protect either an existing structure or the permanent works during construction, or to support an item of plant or equipment, or the vertical sides or side-slopes of an excavation during construction operations on site or to provide access. It is used to control stability, strength, deflection, fatigue, geotechnical effects and hydraulic effects within defined limits." - *Clause 5.1.1.1, [[BS 5975 2019]].

Temporary works are, in essence, the preliminary or supportive work which facilitates and enables future or current works. I have been involved in temporary work design and it encompasses a whole range of different [design work](notes/Civil%20Engineering%20MOC/Design%20MOC/Design%20MOC.md).
