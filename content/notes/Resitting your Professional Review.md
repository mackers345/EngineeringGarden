# Resitting your Professional Review

If, like me, you did not pass your professional review on the first try, do not worry! It is straight forward to sit it again. The process is as follows, as per the [ICE Guidance](https://www.ice.org.uk/media/jnsfsnor/professional-review-guidance.pdf).

> If you have previously been unsuccessful at a Professional Review you will need to undertake the whole application process again. No information regarding a previous application will be made available to your Reviewers. You should therefore prepare in the same way you did for your original Professional Review and upload your new application documents accordingly. New sponsor questionnaires will also be required. For a resit, the reviewers must be satisfied that you have demonstrated competence for all attributes at the review to be successful
