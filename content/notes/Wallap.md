# Wallap

> Wallap is a computer modelling software for the analysis of propped and cantilever [Retaining Wall](notes/Retaining%20Wall.md)s. It can be used for a whole range of wall types, the list of which can be found [here](http://www.geosolve.co.uk/wallap1.htm). 

## Getting Started
Wallap can be a confusing and complicated software if you do not know where to start! Firstly, this will not be a comprehensive guide, and pretty much every question you could have can be found by pressing the F1 key. 

> The F1 key is usually the answer for solving whatever issue you are facing. It will either open a new window, through which more information can be input, or links you to a Help Centre overview which can give you the answer or a source from which you can find it. The key is contextual, so you do not have to go hunting for too long to find what you need.
