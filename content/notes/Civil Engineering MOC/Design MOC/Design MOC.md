# Design MOC
I started completing civil engineering design work as part of a [[Temporary Works]] design team. I am slowly gathering new methods and ways of solving problems, which I will share here for future reference. Below are a set of methods in different areas.

## Geotechnics
 - [Calculate bearing capacity of soils](notes/Calculate%20bearing%20capacity%20of%20soils.md)
 - [Factor of safety for slopes (temporary and permanent)](notes/Factor%20of%20safety%20for%20slopes%20(temporary%20and%20permanent).md)
 - [Converting track load to an equivalent line load](notes/Converting%20track%20load%20to%20an%20equivalent%20line%20load.md)
 - [Wallap](notes/Wallap.md)
 - [Calculating vertical settlement in relation to wall deflection](notes/Calculating%20vertical%20settlement%20in%20relation%20to%20wall%20deflection.md)
 - [Difference in failure slip surface between granular and cohesive soils](notes/Difference%20in%20failure%20slip%20surface%20between%20granular%20and%20cohesive%20soils.md)
## Steel

## Concrete

## Actions on Structures
 - [HB loading](notes/HB%20loading.md)
