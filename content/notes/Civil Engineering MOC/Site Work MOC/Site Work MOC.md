# Site Work
The majority of my time within the civil engineering industry has been spent on site. That is, completing setting out activities, managing work gangs, planning and programming tasks and monitoring works. 

The majority of regulations around site work are dictated by a set of legislation. Two useful things to know inside and out is:

 - ðŸ‘· [Health and Safety at Work Act (1974)](notes/Health%20and%20Safety%20at%20Work%20Act%20(1974).md)
 - ðŸ“‘ [Construction Design and Management Regulations (CDM) (2015)](notes/Construction%20Design%20and%20Management%20Regulations%20(CDM)%20(2015).md)

There are different methodologies and techniques which can be adopted to solve engineering problems. To delve into some of these disciplines, use the links below:
