# Priced Contract
Priced contracts are where a lump sum of work is allocated for a project, and money is released under different conditions. This generally places more risk on the contractor carrying out the work, as if the works are more expensive than estimated, the contractor must bear that cost. Conversely however, savings can also benefit the contractor.

**[[Option A Activity Schedule]]** - This is a form of contract where money is released based on activities being completed. I tend to remember this by thinking that this contract type is more suitable for activities where the exact quantity is hard to define. For example, this contract type is more applicable to a package such as Vegetation Clearance; an activity might be to clear a section of site. The contractor can create this Activity Schedule and agree it with the client. If this was an Option B contract, it would require the individual number of trees to be defined and costed accordingly, which would become unfeasible. The lump sum agreed is open to change through the use of [[Compensation Event (CE)]]s if additional activities are required.

The advantage of an [[Option A Activity Schedule]] for a Client is that it improves cost certainty and transfers this [[risk]] to the contractor. Contrary to an [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract, where the contractor can start work and charge for the materials used by remeasuring, the Client knows upfront what each activity is going to cost and it is down to the Contractor to ensure the activities are completed under budget to make profit. There is almost zero-risk for the client in a case like this.

**[[Option B Bill of Quantities]]** - Contrary to Option A, the work is priced in physical units, set out in a Bill of Quantities. An applicable works package for use with this contract may be a bored piling contractor, where the exact number of piles is known from the start and therefore the materials required to complete the work can be derived. It may set out the quantity of concrete for a pile pour, the hire of the plant needed, the cost of steelwork, and everything else related to the work. One benefit this has over the Option A contract is that money can be released as material are used and a proportion of work is completed, contrary to Option A where money is released only when an activity has been fully completed.

In the [[Allocation of Risk]] debate, the [[Option B Bill of Quantities]] contract transfers much more risk towards the Client. The costs are much harder to control and predict. To incorporate a level of certainty for the Client, the contract can contain a set of [[Disallowed Costs]]. These generally include [[Preliminaries]], which include costs for labour, staff, overheads, site security and everything that facilitates the completion of the work. It does not include the actual cost of materials. This incentivises the Contractor to complete the project to the key dates set out by the Client.

Without certain measures, a Contractor could start work and remeasure heavily in their favour. There would be little recourse if the 

There is a distinct difference between Option A and B in that in Option A, payment is only issued when an activity is "fully completed". In other contracts, there can be the issue of payment under certain circumstances for "partial" or "substantial" completion, however this is not the case under [[NEC3]].
