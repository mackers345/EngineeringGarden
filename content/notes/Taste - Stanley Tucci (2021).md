# Mental Model
---
MM:: Acclaimed actor, author and homely cook [Stanley Tucci](notes/Stanley%20Tucci.md) takes the reader on a tour of his childhood, acting and philosophy through the means of food. Each chapter of his life is centered around a particular dish, whether it be his father's simple *"Eggs with Tomato"*, or the family's decadent Christmas *"Timpano"*: a multi-layered pasta and meat concoction to be slaved over and devoured quickly. In a similar way, I chomped down this book in a matter of days, invested and enveloped in a warm-hearted, starchy embrace, listening to Tucci's stories and being astounded by his passion for sharing and kindness for those around him.

> I must admit that years ago I never thought that my passion and interest in food would come close to eclipsing how I felt about my chosen profession. Acting, directing, cinema, and the theater had always defined me. But after my diagnosis I discovered that eating, drinking, the kitchen, and the table now play those roles. Food not only feeds me, it enriches me. All of me. Mind, body, and soul. It is nothing more than everything.

## the Mediterranean way
A main takeaway from this book that I brought into my own life is that food should not be a shameful enjoyment. Myself and my partner love our food and travel long distances to seek out the best (in the UK, Everyday People in Nottingham for the best Japanese fusion food, or Grazie in Sheffield for the freshest pasta). The way in with Tucci regails stories of his past, rooted in the food and people made me truly think how important food is. My fiance is essentially half-Italian and it pains me to say that the tradition of eating round a large table with fresh food has slipped slightly, especially through the dreaded pandemic. This book inspired me to seek out fresher ingredients and cook simply, infusing time and love into the most basic of dishes. To try and focus on the task at hand away from distraction.

## simplicity
I found the sections around family and sharing the most resonant in the book. Tucci spends far more time on this than simply describing his ascension through the acting world. One theme that stuck out particularly was [[tradition]] and [[legacy]]. The fact that the ideals and opinions of our ancestors travel down the branches of family; evident in the lengthy tangents about which pasta shapes suit which sauces, and the tradition of serving particular dishes at celebrations. You can hear Tucci's passion for this when hearing of the encouragement he gives to his own children. This has made me seek out and question my own families traditions; to seek stories which may help me understand them on a deeper level.

> People often wonder why, if there is such a huge first course, there is even a need for a second course at all. I have no answer for them. All I know is that it is traditional. It is very rare that one eats in an Italian home and both a *primo* and *secondo* are not served on any given day.

## who would I recommend this book to?
If you are driving a long distance, or want a book to remind you of the importance of [[Slow Living]], then this is perfect.


## if you liked this...
I feel like [[Storyworthy - Matthew Dicks (2018)]] may be a recommendation along with any other book, but this stands out as an obvious companion.
