MM:: A whistle stop tour of the main philosophical thinkers and theorists and how they work in practice. Easy to understand and gives the fundamentals. The main areas of [[Philosophy]] are: [[Deontology]], which boils down to everyone should follow a clear set of rules which define whether an action is good or bad. [[Moral Theory]], and subsequent [[Utilitarianism]]  from [Immanuel Kant](notes/Immanuel%20Kant.md) denotes that the best thing to do is the thing that creates the most tangible benefit, in terms of quantity. In the trolley problem, this would be that the 5 people should be saved as this has the greatest intrinsic output. The difference between [[Moral Theory]] and [[Utilitarianism]] is that the latter considers the output to be happiness, rather than moral worth. Expand the research and understanding of [[Virtue Ethics]] and the other definitions in your spare time. 

The big takeaway are essentially two quotes, which Schur instills into his own children in a touching send-off to the book. 

> “Thousands of years ago, in a part of Greece called Delphi, some people built a temple. They were worried about their kids too—all parents in history have been worried about their kids, it’s not just Mom and me—so they chiseled a couple of sayings into a column of that temple to tell their kids, and their grandkids, and their great-grandkids, in as few words as possible, how to try to pull off the nearly impossible task of living a good life on earth. Here’s what they wrote:
> 
> **Know thyself.**
> 
> and
> 
> **Nothing in excess.**
> 
> Honestly, as far as “guides to life” go, I don’t think anyone’s beaten that in the 2,400 years since. Know thyself—think about who you are, check in with yourself when you do things to see if you’ve made good decisions, remember what you value and care about, understand your integrity, and live a life consistent with that integrity. Nothing in excess—because too much (or too little) of anything will screw you up. Practice virtues like kindness and generosity and courage, but not too much of them. Drink whiskey, when you’re old enough, but don’t drink too much whiskey. (Single malt, by the way. None of that blended junk.) Watch TV, but don’t watch too much TV. Don’t eat too many tacos, or exercise too much, or curse too much (I struggle with that one). Somewhere in the middle of every kind of virtue you can have, and every thing you do, there’s a perfect amount of that thing, and your job is to find it. You want a real Quick-Start Guide for how to live a good life? A guide so pithy you can have it tattooed on your arm with plenty of room to spare?
