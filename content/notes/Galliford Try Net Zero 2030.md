# Galliford Try Net Zero 2030

Galliford Try is addressing the climate emergency by committing to Net Zero carbon across it's own operations by 2030, and Net Zero across all activities by 2045. They have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5-degrees-Celsius to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. 

They have reduced CO2 equivalent emissions, in terms of [Scopes of Carbon-Dioxide Emissions](notes/Scopes%20of%20Carbon-Dioxide%20Emissions.md), by 62% through a combination of the following activities:

1) Using renewable energy sources, where possible, for permanent offices and supporting electric vehicle use with charging points at it's workplaces.
2) Encouraging the use of electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, which represent 36% of the total vehicle fleet.
3) Promoting the use of electric and alternatively-fuelled plant on sites
4) Earlier grid connections to minimise diesel use on projects.
5) Operating an agile working policy.

## Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions
