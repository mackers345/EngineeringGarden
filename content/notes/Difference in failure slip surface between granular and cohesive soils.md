# Difference in failure slip surface between granular and cohesive soils

Depending on the type of ground at a slope location, the type of slip failure will vary.

**For granular material**, that is where the cohesive strength is zero, the slip surface will be shallow, parallel to the slope surface. Imagine the front face of the slope slipping and crumbling towards the ground. Typically, this can be remediated through on-site measures.

**For cohesive material**, that is clayey or silty materials with cohesive strength, the slip surfaces are much more deep seated. The friction angle can be calculated using equations considering the cohesion and friction angle of the soil, or through computational methods using slope.
