# Decarbonisation and climate impacts
There is some overlap in the areas of decarbonisation and climate impacts in regards to the [Communication Task](notes/Communication%20Task.md), so both can be covered in this note. 

> [!NOTE] Definition
> Decarbonisation, as [defined by the UN](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/11/1130462) is shorthand for "finding alternative ways of living and working that reduce emissions and capture and store carbon in our soil and vegetation". A more [expansive definition](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/decarbonization) could be "the process of stopping or reducing carbon gases, especially carbon dioxide, being released into the atmosphere as the result of a process, for example the burning of fossil fuels".
