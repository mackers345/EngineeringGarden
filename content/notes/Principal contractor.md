# Principal contractor
> A principal contractor is appointed by the client to control the construction phase of any project involving multiple [contractors](notes/Contractor.md). 

It is important that the principal contractor has suitable skills, knowledge, experience and where relevant, organisational capability to carry out a project in the size and scope being carried out.

When working for a [domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md), the [principal contractor](notes/Principal%20contractor.md) will usually take on the [client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) duties as well as their own. If the client does not appoint a principal contractor, then their duties must be carried out by the [contractor](notes/Contractor.md) in control of the construction phase.

The principal contractor must:

-   [plan](https://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/safetytopics/planning.htm), manage, monitor and coordinate the entire construction phase
-   take account of the health and safety risks to everyone affected by the work (including members of the public), in planning and managing the measures needed to control them
-   liaise with the client and [principal designer](notes/Principal%20designer.md) for the duration of the project to ensure that all risks are effectively managed
-   prepare a written [construction phase plan (PDF)](https://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis80.pdf) before the construction phase begins, implement, and then regularly review and revise it to make sure it remains fit for purpose
-   have ongoing arrangements in place for managing health and safety throughout the construction phase
-   consult and engage with workers about their health, safety and welfare
-   ensure suitable welfare facilities are provided from the start and maintained throughout the construction phase
-   check that  anyone they appoint has the skills, knowledge, experience and, where relevant, the organisational capability to carry out their work safely and without risk to health
-   ensure all [workers](https://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/workers.htm) have site-specific inductions, and any further information and training they need
-   take steps to prevent unauthorised access to the site
-   liaise with the principal designer to share any information relevant to the planning, management, monitoring and coordination of the pre-construction phase
