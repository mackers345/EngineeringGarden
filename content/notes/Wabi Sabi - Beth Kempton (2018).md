MM:: There is beauty in everyday objects, and the rituals we go through. Try to slow down and enjoy the little things. 
Acceptance: Acceptance means saying:

1.  This is what is happening (observe it, donâ€™t resist it).
2.  This is how much it really matters (if at all).
3.  This is the beginning of all that is to come, and this is what I am going to do next.

There is a beautiful passage in this book around a meal, that was gifted to her after a misbooking. It revolves around a light in the ceiling which shows the outside, which changes colours for each course of the meal. The colour changes the sky itself, showing that changing the frame can change the reality of the situation. Also the two different cameras she photographed it through gave two different outcomes, showing that the lens through which we look can change our perception as well.
