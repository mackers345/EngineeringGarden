# Mental Model
MM:: Most productivity books imply that with enough optimisation, that you can fit everything into your life that you want to. This book states that for a happy life this just isn't practical and suggests that finding ways to cut out obligations and make un-optimal decisions sometimes frees up time and makes us happier.

Notes from [[Ali Abdaal]]'s summary video.  
Our lives are broken down into roughly 4000 weeks. This book takes a philosophical approach as to how to spend this time wisely.
Some problems we face:
### Online Distraction
### Decision Paralysis
CHoosing one option shuts the door on other options.

> You do not have enough time for all the things that matter - Burkeman

> The future appeals to us more than teh present moment because it appears to us in a multiitude of pleasant forms all at the same time - [[Henri Bergson]] [[Quotes]]

### In Denial
#### Clearing the Decks
Where we put off big tasks that are important to us, instead working on the small urgent tasks. The small urgent tasks never really go away however. This is basically procrastination. 

#### Submitting to Distraction
Most people are willing accomplices in our own distraction.

> Distractions aren't the ultimate cause of our distraction. Although well-engineered, they're ultimately just the place we go to seek relief from the discomfort of facing our limitations - Burkeman

#### Embracing your limits:
 - Accept defeat - embrace the fact that we can't get everything done and there is no cure for this. We are setting the bar way too high.
 - Rediscovering wonder - stop resenting, be grateful for existing at all.
 - Find meaning in finitude

## Tips for less stress
### Practice doing nothing
Practice letting things be, don't rush into commitments just to feel busy.
### Rediscover rest
Don't see leisure time as just a way to recover after work, intentionally embracing a sort of leisure which doesn't have a later benefit. Just be content!
### Pay yourself first
Do the thing for ourselves first, for example going to the gym or working on your own goals. That is what I am doing today!
### Decide when to fail
Intentionally fail certain tasks if it requires too much work or time. Decide what can survive on the bare-minimum. What is your highest priority?
### Limit our work in progress
Use an open and closed to do list. Write down everything open on one side, and choose a maximum of 3-5 things on the closed list which has to be completed. This is just a quick way to prioritise what you have to complete.
### Serialise, serialise, serialise
Choose one big project to focus on at once.
