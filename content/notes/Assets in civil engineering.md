# Asset management


> [!NOTE] Assets
> An asset is a resource with **economic value** that an individual, corporation or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit.

> [!NOTE] Asset management
> Asset management therefore is a strategic approach that seeks to optimise the allocation of resources for the management, operation, preservation and enhancement of the highway infrastructure to meet the needs of current and future users of the transport network. This should be applied to other industries as well, enhancing and preserving existing assets to ensure that they can be used for generations to come.

## Digital assets


> [!NOTE] Digital assets
> There is a whole landscape of digital assets which can be controlled in a similar way to physical assets. The threat of malware, rapid replacement cycles and the aggressive threat landscape can be a hindrance to the promotion of digital assets however. 

#### Why do we need cyber security?
Cyber security can make private and sensitive information secure against an outside or inside threat. The common methods of cyber attack are:

1) Insider - an Insider threat can be defined as ‘a current or former employee, contractor or other business partner with access to the organization’s network, system or data and intentionally misuses them or whose access results in misuse’.
2) Phishing - phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email. The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information.
3) In-path interception - also known as eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. Common points of entry: on unsecure public Wi-Fi and via previously inserted malware.
4) Malware - Malware is a term used to describe a family of malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. Malware breaches a network through a vulnerability, to: block or obtain access to key network components.
5) Web Attacks and DoS - a family of sophisticated techniques to exploit unpatched software and web applications.

There is a whole host of legislation around network and information security.

#### Day-to-day management of cyber-security
There are very few contractual obligations to ensure cyber-security within an organisation. However, general ethics dictate a duty-of-care should be employed to protect user's security. Fundamentally, ISO 55001 has cyber security at it's core.

We can protect cyber security with a 6-step process:
1) Analyse
2) Plan
3) Implement
4) Monitor
5) Respond
6) Review
