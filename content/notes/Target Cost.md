# Target Cost
The Target Cost contract type differs from the Priced Contracts in that the risk is shared between the contractor and the client, in that a pre-agreed "pain/gain" share is agreed whereby any savings are shared between the client and contractor, as well as any losses as a result from exceeding the agreed price. The benefit of these type of contracts is that, as the NEC repeatedly encourages, collaboration is a necessity and it promotes that the client and subcontractor work together positively to secure success for both parties.

**[[Option C: Activity Schedule]]** - The way of defining the work to completed is the same as set out in Option A, however the underlying Target Cost mechanism is different.

**[[Option D: Bill of Quantities]]** - As above, works activities are defined on a quantified material basis as per Option B, but with the Target Cost in place.
