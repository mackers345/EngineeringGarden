# Pre-construction information
The pre-construction information which can be provided to the [Designer](notes/Designer.md) and [Contractor](notes/Contractor.md) by the [Commercial client](notes/Commercial%20client.md) or [Domestic client](notes/Domestic%20client.md) includes:

 - The project, including a summary of the work to be completed, budget and timescale
 - The team to be carrying out the work from the client's side
 - The client's considerations and management requirements
 - Environmental restrictions and existing site risks
 - Significant design and construction hazards
 - Design hazard register

This is to ensure teams bidding for the work have a full understanding of the scope and constraints present in the project.
