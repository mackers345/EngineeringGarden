# Summary Note

> [!NOTE] Summary Note
> The purpose of a summary note is to provide a brief summary of a topic so that the reader gets a general comprehensive understanding.

This will be a relatively straightforward method of writing, I think it is beneficial to use the SMEAC approach to writing it out:

### Format
Introductory sentence / abstract
Table of Contents / summary of headings
Introduction
Situation
Mission
Methods
Results
Discussion
Conclusion

Do not forget to add graphics, colour and make the formatting engaging and attentive. Put some nice graphics ready to drag and drop into the document as part of your A4 sheets.

*Example: Summary Note for University Students*
- What audience characteristics do you need to consider? 
- What do you think your audience’s main interest will be in your views in the subject area?
- How many key points do you think it would be appropriate to explore?
- What are the main points you want to get across?
- Bearing in mind this is a closed book exercise, how can you make your note engaging and attractive for your audience?
